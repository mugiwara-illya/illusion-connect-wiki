Her business acumen is off the charts, but she is carefree and loves to try out new things.\nAs the only heir to the Suga family, Miyuki was born with a silver spoon. She has just about any privilege imaginable and near-infinite wealth. She is honest and rarely resorts to manipulation, but her comprehensive understanding of how the world works and how to get what she wants is exactly why no one can be spared.",
